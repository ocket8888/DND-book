# DND-book
A book written to tell the story of my first Dungeons and Dragons campaign. Also contains character backstory.

This project uses XeLateX, run through MikTeX to build the final pdf. It contains commands that make use of fonts which are **not** provided, and are subject to their own licenses. The style of the document is based heavily on [this project](https://github.com/evanbergeron/DND-5e-LaTeX-Template).
